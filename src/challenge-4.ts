// What is the difference between unknown and any?

// `unknown` is the type-safe counterpart of any. Anything is assignable to unknown, but unknown isnâ€™t assignable to anything but itself and any without a type assertion or a control flow based narrowing. Operations on an unknown variable require you to assert or narrow down to a more specific type first.
// Unlike `any`, with `unknown`, you cannot access any properties on values with type `unknown`, as it will error.
// They are both a universal supertype, but you should use unknown to signal that the value can be anything and so type checking must be performed before it is used.


// What are Record, A and B in Record<A, B>?

// They are type variables. Using type variables allow us to capture the type the user provides so that we can use that information later. For example, if a user inputs A as a string and B as a number, later through the function if we created new variables `foo` of type A and `bar of type B, `foo` would be a string and `bar` would be a number.


// Can you give an example of a place where Generics would help the TypeScript type-checker (and therefore you)?

// In this function:
// function identity(arg: any): any {
//     return arg;
// }

// since the arg is type any and the return output is type any, they could be different. but say you wanted them to be the same -- the compiler wouldn't know

// so, you could use generics:

// function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
//     return arg;
// }

// now you can guarantee the input type and return type are actually the same.
